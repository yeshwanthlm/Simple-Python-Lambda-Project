# Simple-Python-Lambda-Project

## Project: 

Write a Lambda script that triggers when a file lands in an S3 bucket, and moves it to a folder named YYYMMDD/filename in the destination bucket based on when the file was created in the Source S3 Bucket. \

Usecase: https://youtu.be/vUwojKBgjcs

## Prerequisites:

An AWS account \
Zeal to build! \

## Steps: 

Step 1: Create Source and Destination S3 Buckets. 
```sh
S3 Bucket Names:
Source Bucket: amc-aws-lambda-s3-project-source
Destination Bucket: amc-aws-lambda-s3-project-destination
```
Step 2: Create a Lambda Function. 
```sh
Lambda Function Name: amc-aws-lambda-s3-project-function
IAM Role Name: amc-aws-lambda-s3-project-role
```
Step 3: Add S3 Trigger to the Lambda Funtion. \
Step 4: Write the Lambda Code. \
Step 5: Save and Test the Lambda Function 

## Conclusion: 

And that's it! You've created a Lambda function that triggers when a file is added to an S3 bucket and moves it to a new folder based on when it was created. This is just one example of what you can do with AWS Lambda and S3, and the possibilities are endless.
